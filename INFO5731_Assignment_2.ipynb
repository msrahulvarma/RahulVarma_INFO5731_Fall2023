            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

            "I sighed the entire time. No element of surprise. It has all been seen and done before. I was just predicting in my head what happens next. Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination.

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

            "As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie.

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot.

Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it.

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie.

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot.

Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",

Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it.

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

            "As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie.

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot.

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

            "I sighed the entire time. No element of surprise. It has all been seen and done before. I was just predicting in my head what happens next. Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD. What do these movies have in common? The Creator took from all of them and also manages to be worse than all of them.\n",

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it.

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie.

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

            "As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie.

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot.

Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie.

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie.

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore.

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated.

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination.

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie.

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

            "As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

            "I sighed the entire time. No element of surprise. It has all been seen and done before. I was just predicting in my head what happens next. Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD. What do these movies have in common? The Creator took from all of them and also manages to be worse than all of them.\n",

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame.

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore.

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it.

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie.

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.\n",

            "As the opening kicks off there's expectations, that the film that's being screened has firm foundations, and to be fair it's a good start, rise of machines is at its heart, as well as difference, evolving change and diverse nations. There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore. At the end you'll find the steam has all escaped, that the barrel comes so close to being scraped, an apocalypse of ages, just another war that rages, you're disappointed as you leave, and your coats draped.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie.

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot.

Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears.

To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame.

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore.

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem?

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it.

The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects.

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie.

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

            "This new sci-fi film from Gareth Edwards (Rogue One) was made for $80 million but looks like $350 million on screen. It's a global epic on a massive scale. This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame.

There are hints of lots of things you've seen before, wars of stars and running blades are all top drawer, but once the façade has been cracked, you'll feel as though you're being hacked, as the pace turns to a saunter, and starts to bore.

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

            "Oh, I really wanted to like this movie. Edwards did a great job with Rogue One. He missed the mark with this one. First the positives.Movie looks amazing. The world feels lived in and something that I felt was a real place. Edwards is great at world building. Actors were all pretty great.. at least with the material they were given. Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid.

After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

            "When the trailer for The Creator came out, I basically became a Facebook Disney fangirl but, like, the opposite.I was all \"OMGOMG it's a big Hollywood sci-fi movie but, like, it's made by a director with a voice and... Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

            "Absolutely stunning work from director Gareth Edwards and cinematographer Oren Soffer. Shot on a Sony FX3 and on location. Impressive. From color grades, shots and VFX...all top notch. A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch. Oh and ill never watch anything with John Washington again lol.\n",

            "7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

Nirmata was the wife and the AI kid was theirs, like the audience did not figure that one out from the get go.There are some decent visuals, but that's about it. The characters are all empty and void of any credibility. The screenplay was so bad it was really distracting me from following this hollow shell of a movie. The dialogue was awful and the jokes did not land. This movie wants me to feel bad about robots, but I was just rooting for mankind the entire time.Why do the rebels need an AI child to destroy Nomad? In the end it was the protagonist with a measly bomb that did the job. Did the AI not blow up LA, then how is a spaceship a problem? This dumb kid is a literal plot device to move this soulless tripe forward.How did Nomad never find an AI monastery on top of the highest mountain range on earth lol.Ex Machina, Chappie, Elysium, I-Robot, Star Wars, Avatar, Blade Runner and Babylon AD.

            "Right, well I was really disappointed with this. It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes. Bet it cost a fortune, but it's all just a bit forgettably lacking.\n",

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",

            "We went to see this in IMAX and really wanted to enjoy it but it felt flat for us. The story is bad. The dialogues are bad. People commenting that the dialogues are so bad that they seem written by an AI are absolutely right. It´s predictable. You don´t feel for the characters, any of them. The special effects didn´t seem like something new either. It´s very formulaic. Like written for children. I don´t even think that teenagers will enjoy it. It would have to be younger than preteens and I wouldn´t recommend it even then. There is no story to tell. I´m sorry we went to the cinema to see this, it wasn´t worth it.\n",

            "This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent.It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments.The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua.The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two.It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new.Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.\n",

            "The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill.It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless.The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film.There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid.Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.\n",

            "My wife and I caught The Creator (2023) in theaters last night. The storyline unfolds in a futuristic society where humans and AI robots find themselves in conflict, triggered by an AI robot-initiated a nuclear attack on Los Angeles that claimed a million human lives. A man, once assigned to bring down the leader of the AI robots, experiences a devastating loss of his wife and child during an undercover mission. The government offers him a chance to complete one last mission with the promise of reuniting with his wife, and he eagerly accepts the opportunity to right past wrongs.Directed by Gareth Edwards (Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), the film stars John David Washington (Tenet), Madeleine Yuna Voyles, Gemma Chan (Eternals), Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai), Allison Janney (The Help) and Marc Menchaca (Ozark).While the storyline bore strong resemblances to Blade Runner, unfortunately, the plot of The Creator proved to be highly predictable, with only one noteworthy twist, and I didn't find myself as invested in the characters as I had hoped. On the positive side, the acting, special effects, cinematography and settings were magnificent, but throughout the entire film, there was a sense that something crucial was missing. Additionally, the film's extended runtime led to certain sections that dragged. However, it's worth noting that the ending was satisfying, and every action scene and shootout was executed exceptionally well, making this worth your time.In conclusion, The Creator is a modernized take on the Blade Runner formula that falls short of greatness due to a missing element. I would give this a 6/10 rating and recommend seeing it once.\n",

            "The Terminator films warned us of the dangers of A. I., while the Spielberg/Kubrick movie A. I. painted a different picture in which robots served mankind. Gareth Edwards' The Creator gives us another take on the subject, bringing us a future where America has waged war on intelligent machines to cover up for an accidental nuclear explosion on home soil.Edwards' film tries to blend sci-fi and action with the ethical issues surrounding artificial intelligence, but in doing so it becomes something of a mess, one that clumsily combines big-budget CGI extravaganza with hamfisted morality, with intended emotionally charged scenes hampered by some truly lousy dialogue (poor Madeleine Yuna Voyles, as Alphie, is given all the worst lines -- Kami: What do you want, sweetie? Alphie: For robots to be free. Gack!).The film also doesn't make a whole lot of sense at times: I realise that the simulants are supposed to be very human-like, but did they really need to eat and drink? And cry? And why were some simulants young, and others old (one simulant is a decrepit Tibetan monk! Why would he be made like that?). And if Maya created Alphie before she got blasted into a coma, why would she have used her unborn child as the template? (to further the film's plot, of course!).It's a shame that the script isn't less problematic, because the film is amazing to look at, a triumph of special effects and incredible production design: it's the stunning visuals that helped me make it to the end.4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb.\n",

This is how I like films to look, I think it was probably shot on digital but they've made it look like it was shot on film. It does have shades of Terminator, Blade Runner and even Terrence Malick but it also brings some new dimensions to some classic themes. Not only the craftsmanship but the acting is also top notch in this fully immersive tale. It moves very quickly which will help you get past sone story logistics that might crumble on closer examination. A superb effort that leaves the glossy soulless and often brainless blockbusters of recent decades in the dust. A quality film that I recommend supporting in the theaters.\n",

            "Sigh. As a self-proclaimed sci-fi junkie, I was looking forward to this new original stand-alone sci-fi movie. And I left fully disappointed. It's exactly like so many movies I've seen before. I basically knew how the entire movie would play out in the first five minutes.Even so, I've enjoyed plenty of movies that seem derivative. If it's done right, it can be good or even great without any originality. But everything about this movie feels off. I can see what it's trying to do. It's just not working. Character arcs and changes in perspective feel completely unearned. Emotional moments evoke no emotions.Even with all that, could I at least enjoy some cool sci-fi action? Not really. It feels mostly tame and surface-level. Part of it is the annoying limitations with PG-13 movies, avoiding all violence even with death all over the place. But it's more that the action isn't creative or... intimate? Shooting scenes are just a bunch of bullets flying everywhere (with terrible aim). And throw in explosions every now and then.People who don't watch many movies will probably enjoy it more than me. But I can't recommend this movie. It could not get me engaged or invested, which is not a difficult task for someone who loves movie as much as I do.(1 viewing, early access screening UltraScreen 9/27/2023)\n",

            "Many Spoilers Ahead.It seems obvious for some movies that the script writers aren't even trying to find a new approach to some of the same old tropes of your typical adventure yarn. I found that the case in the slick and enjoyable action flick \"The Gray Man\". \"Creator\" has a lot in common with a lot of mostly cliché movies. Creator and Gray Man both toss a child into the mix. You can consider her either the Chosen One or the Child Prodigy tropes. Like the baby Yoda in \"The Manchurian\". Or the chosen kid in \"The Last Airbender\". There's dozens more examples, like that annoying baby in \"Willow\". The kid is towed along through all of the adventures, and reluctantly uses his magical powers to save our protagonist from certain peril. In \"Creator\", the child prodigy's special powers are sending an electro magnetic pulse (or EMP) wave around him, rendering electronic devices powerless.The dystopian world this time is reminiscent of \"Chappie\" with a robot police force. It could also resemble \"Elysium\", where a more dominant group orbits above in a massive spaceship, sending terror to the villagers down below. The twist they try in Creator is that the villagers are androids. Well, they all look and act like regular humans, they just have a big opening in the back of their heads. Even that type of android seems cliché. The asian setting is meant to evoke images of Viet Nam when, \"Apocalypse Now\"-style, U. S. Forces used advanced military equipment on mostly primitive villagers.What is also uninspiring is the Bourne-ish \"assassin turned compassionate\" trope. In fact our protagonist, named Joshua, even loses his memory after his own Bourne style mission. Another strike against is introducing the subplot while the opening act is unfolding. We are forced to try and juggle a bunch of important plot points while dodging bullets. Another hit and a miss is Joshua's wife, Maya. Within moments, they first are cuddling (with zero chemistry), then suddenly facing each other off when a conflict arises. She disappears for most of the rest of the movie. The script attaches many complicated aspects to her character, which made me go \"Huh?\" \"What?\". Ultimately the revelations about certain main characters that occur throughout the movie made me lose track of who were supposed to be the good guys and the bad guys.Part of the problem is the filmmakers jumping the \"A. I.\" bandwagon. Like Mission: Impossible: 7, the words \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"A. I.\" are sprinkled about in the dialogue, perhaps to cash in on the latest controversy involving A. I. and the threat of it taking over society (such as the Terminator franchise). Here A. I. is the perceived enemy, and has created human-like androids that I am supposed to feel compassion for, because machines are people too (like Data in the Star Trek series).This forced compassion on the main characters wasn't successful for me. In the third act, there at least a couple scenes that are shot and scored to be tearjerker moments, but fall flat. And yes, here we are with a bloated two hour and 13 minute run time, testing the patience of the audience. The story is set up in acts with title pages for each one. The slick look of this obviously expensive production looks great on the big screen, and I guess that was all I was really expecting when I went to watch it in the theatre on a rainy day.Director Gareth Edwards earned my interest by doing an excellent job making \"Rogue One: A Star Wars story\". It certainly doesn't diminish my attitude about him as a filmmaker, but I hope he learns from this experience how to better win the audience's compassion for characters. 5 out of 10.\n",

            "AI is such a rich topic that can be explored from all kinds of angles, but this movie uses the it only as window dressing. The AI people just stand for oppressed people X. None of them are really intelligent, they behave as regular humans and even have to sleep (?!). The movie decides to tell a generic story that we have seen many times before, and with better results.If one ignores the paper thin story and has to describe this movie in one word, it would be messy. Inelegant change of tones, a weird plot structure, unclear action, an unlikeable protagonist that gets everyone killed and even the acting is all over the place.Similar like Neil Blomkamp, the director is more interested in world-building than in gripping storytelling. All the story beats are there, all of them predictable. Every interesting sci-fi idea is discarded in favor of a trope. You got robots who are all portrayed as inherently good (and who never malfunction) and the humans who are either evil military or grateful victims who adore their robot saviors. There are no grey areas, no ambivalent characters or ideas. This predictive setup reminded me a lot of the AVATAR movies. Not only do you have a protagonist who infiltrates 'the resistance' and switches sides, you got the army villain who is almost identical in behaviour and personality.The connective tissue is supposed to be the relationship between the two protagonists. If you expect them bonding slowly over the course of the movie, you should lower your expectations. Instead we get a montage in the beginning of their journey and that's pretty much all the development you'll see in that department. It's almost like the writing was a necessary evil to get from one action set piece to the other.Talking about action, it is the most lifeless I have seen in a blockbuster (since the Transformers films). If the bad guys or our good guys get into a car, they get the biggest plot armour. Cars can get shot at by hundred guns or overturn a million times, they will get out of it unharmed and unphazed, even if they didn't use a seat belt. At one point it is super easy to destroy a giant tank with a small sticky charge, but once successfully applied, no one else will be using this tactic again. The Asian country doesn't have military or defense budget, because they only have useless police cars/robots at their disposal whose sole purpose is to get blown up. And can we talk about explosions and how the director doesn't know how they work. Almost everyone who gets blown up by an explosion will look pretty with some bruises on their cheek, especially the women. There's also a thing called shockwave or blast radius which are the very things that will end your life. Our protagonist gets to witness three of them in point blank range. You have a person with a superpower to switch off all electronic devices, even a whole neighborhood and military checkpoint if the script wants to, but when it comes to a satellite those superpowers suddenly don't work anymore. Almost every action scene ends with a coincidence, deus ex machina or that someone draws a gun faster than the other. Especially the last action set piece is redundant where they send a robot after someone who can turn off electric devices, next time maybe send a monkey with a club to do the job. But mostly you'll see a hundred laser beams flying around without hitting anything or anyone. Again the action is so uninteresting that you never feel that our heroes are in danger, unless it's a side character, well then RIP, they have zero chance of survival. And why should they? They fulfilled their duty of convenient exposition talk so let's just kill them to create artificial stakes. Those parts felt so nihilistic to me and more often than not sabotaged the message of the movie. The flashbacks are another thing that tell you nothing new. Unfortunately they are sprinkled throughout the film to make us artificially care about the protagonist. And that's what this movie is in a nutshell, a story written by an AI with some nice visual ideas but completely devoid of a soul. I was rooting for the movie, it is no remake, has good cinematography and has good world building (only anesthetically though) but it just felt so derivative and un-engaging on an emotional level. It's a shame.\n",

Sound was awesome, and it was just well made on a technical level.What didn't work for me was the story and the script. Edwards doesn't seem to have the writing skills that measure up to his strong director abilities. The story started out strong and had great potential in the first act. It was making the audience pay attention and see how it was all fitting together. The questions about AI seemed to be timely and thought provoking. Then it started to fall apart for me.It just was so flat and predictable. Didn't go to the depths that it teased that it might explore. The biggest thing for me, the massive plot holes. So annoying! For a film that seems to be trying to make a world that we could believe was real.. then the writers need to make things make sense and the characters should do things that are believable for their situations. Few examples.Joshua was trying to get Alphie back after the simulants got him. He sneaks into their area by tip toeing, and flicks a switch on the leaders neck to turn off the robot. They have their power switch right there on their necks!? None of them could detect him as he was sneaking around? After he gets Alphie back, the simulants can't find Alphie. There is no tracking capabilities on him? We can track our cell phones in this day and age, and 50 years in the future, they wouldn't be able to track their most important \"weapon/creation\"? And why did they not protect their important creation. Also the Army comes in with these huge tanks (which were cool) and one explosive device completely disables it. Come on. And the flying base.. don't get me started. Joshua gets on board and destroys it so easily. The most important Army asset and it's practically defenseless. Had me rolling my eyes so many times. Making things make sense is important, especially for a film that tries to be realistic or believable. The army sends these running bombs to hurt the simulants. A missile would do the job and be so much more efficient.I also had an issue with the plot point that the AI just wanted peace and for everyone to love each other. I feel like that is a sort of weak premise. Why would the AI have that perspective? If they were based on the humans or what you would find on the internet, why would they think just loving each other would be possible. The AI wanted to survive, hense the fighting, and that idea just doesn't seem logical. At least it didn't feel believable in the world of this movie. I could not buy that idea from what was presented in the first 2 acts of the movie. I loved the questions that were brought up in the movie, but I just feel like they were not developed in a smart of thought provoking way.The movie could have been so much more. I wish it delivered for me... But I just left feeling disappointed and like the movie was an empty shell. Hopefully Edwards gets better material in the future and can bring his directing talents to material that is stronger and written in a more complete and thoughtful way.\n",

            "Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed.One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you.It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process.Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair?The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film.I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn'tJust one more big-budget wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Gareth Edwards proves himself to be an astoundingly brilliant director with The Creator, as he crafts a visual and auditory world rich with layers of detail, and characters that we quickly understand and naturally grow over the course of the story.He made an $80 million movie that looks like it cost at least twice that. This cost less than half of what Thor: Love and Thunder cost. Let that sink in.Edwards shows he's a better director than writer, as the film is far from original, borrowing concepts and themes from plenty of old classic sci-fi stories. And it's also burdened with some clunky dialogue and rushed, convenient crucial plot points.Yeah, it's imperfect. But it's made with a confidence and care that goes beyond the degree of admirable. It's an earnest expression of love, redemption, sacrifice, and forgiveness put out by a filmmaker who really cares for the characters whose story he's telling.It's a work of art that, even with its flaws, deserves to be seen.\n",

            "Before, I was curious if the movie would delve into thought-provoking internal dilemmas, whether the story would be good or not, if it would be an indie sci-fi or a grand, epic spectacle... because the trailers already teased at impressive visuals as a given, so I hoped that the rest of the movie would live up to them. Ideally, it's better to get into the movie without watching trailers, but I couldn't avoid them, the cinema had been playing the Creator trailers as previews for other movies for a while.I wasn't getting myself too excited for this because it could've easily been a cliche and unimaginative, but it wasn't and still had an original feel to it. The short background was nice, especially since the human vs. AI theme has been explored before. It was good that the movie didn't dwell on developing plot points that didn't bring anything new to the table. The world-building was well done and gave the film a sense of familiarity.I thought this was gonna be an indie sci-fi flick, but the sheer vastness and visual splendor put away any concern of the \"small\" budget it had being restrictive. It's remarkable, especially when you compare it to many other big-budget TV shows and movies that don't achieve this level of visual excellence. The explosions were cool and plenty; while still not being overdone. Visually, everything was executed perfectly; it was a true spectacle. I liked the slightly grainy texture it had, instead of the smooth shiny CGI feel like that seen in MCU films.I liked the storytelling approach of breaking the movie into chapters. It gave the movie a sci-fi narrative or dramatic feel rather than being purely action-packed, although there was plenty of action as well. As I mentioned earlier, there were a lot explosions, but they were handled sensibly and maturely, yet still managed to bring that childlike excitement in me that likes seeing things go boom.It was funny in a subtle way, they weren't trying to sneak them in and it's not getting big belly laughs. The pacing was good, and overall, it was was just a well-crafted film. The world-building was gradual, allowing you to learn about this world as the movie unfolded, rather than through an upfront introduction to it all. This world was well crafted, showed depth and thoughtful design.Why would a war vet have an alarm clock that triggers his ptsd???? That was the one unintentionally funny scene, literally burst out laughing at that. Anyway, Sound track music score was great, different from what I usually remember Hans zimmer for, but I should say I don't have a keen ear for that sorta stuff. I was only paying attention because I knew it was zimmer.It somewhat felt like a breath of fresh air, of course the human vs AI trope isn't new, but this was done right and didn't feel like a repeat or rip-off. It's a sci-fi film with heart and genuine emotions. As far as the plot, it reminded me of Hugh Jackman's solo Wolverine film, Logan. And the cast did well too, a very decent cast who put in wonderful performances, from both antagonists and protagonists sides. Standout was Madeleine Yuna Voyles, who portrayed the character Alphie exceptionally well. I was also impressed by Allison Janney's believably ruthless portrayal; Washington and Ken Watanabe once again showed their acting prowess.The plot and its twists and turns weren't mind-bending, there were several moments where you could piece things together before the movie officially unveiled them or before the characters caught on. But, I consciously tried to avoid predicting where it was heading. The final act was a pleasant surprise, at one point in the movie, I thought it was reaching its end, but that it was just the beginning of the final stretch. So for me, it felt like a bonus lol.I was curious as the movie went on if it was going to end a full story arc, or simply just a set up more sequels. I loved that it felt like a natural ending to the story while also leaving the door open for potential sequels. The ending seemed inevitable but I wish it was different, but as I said it felt natural so mixed feelings. The pacing was impressive, and the plot was lean, without any unnecessary stuff. Despite its simplicity, pretty significant events unfolded throughout the movie, keeping the narrative interesting.This movie is emotionally evocative; beyond sci-fi, it carries the weight of a war drama, which naturally comes with emotional impact. The storytelling is told in a way that tugs at your heartstrings, particularly sympathizing with the AI robot side, but when it comes to the \"bad guys,\" the Americans, you can understand their logic but don't necessarily side with them. The American military personnel are portrayed as very typical, following the textbook design. They view the other side not as people but as enemies, which makes them ruthless and seemingly heartless in their pursuit, all in service to their country bla bla bla.One aspect I wished the movie had explored further is the theme of emotional dilemmas, particularly whether AI can be considered as beings with feelings. It attempts to touch on this with the \"who gets to go to Heaven\" theme, but the rest of the movie didn't delve as deeply into these themes as I had anticipated.Unfortunately, I don't think it's a movie for everyone; it's more enjoyable if you're already a sci-fi fan. This is one of the reasons why I wouldn't rate it a 10/10. For me, that would place it on the same level as \"Interstellar,\" a sci-fi movie so exceptional that it transcends genre preferences. Nonetheless, I still think it's one of the best scifi movies in years. While I'm tempted to say it's the best since \"Interstellar,\" i think that sparks comparisons and I think it's more comparable to films like \"Rogue One.\" Better, maybe, but I haven't watched that movie in years.\n",

            "The Creator is an all too rare piece of original epic sci-fi that's built on very familiar foundations and uses them to create something that's as visually exciting as it is emotionally investing, completely unafraid to show American military might for the soulless monster it is.John David Washington plays his reluctant father figure in terrific fashion, closed off at first but those barriers are all successfully worn down by the end. In her screen debut Madeleine Yuna Voyles is amazing, adorable and undoubtedly the main reason any of this works on an emotional level.Supporting them is Ken Watanabe being as effortlessly stoic as always and Allison Janney as an antagonist with a solid amount of depth all thanks to just one scene which efficiently explains her viewpoint in a believable fashion but she's also just plain ruthless in her relentless pursuit.Gareth Edwards once again proves he doesn't need established franchises to create epic imagery or fascinating worlds on a blockbuster scale. Between the stunning cinematography by Greig Fraser & Oren Soffer and the ridiculously impressive CG it outdoes the majority of the competition on a fraction of the cost.Uncharacteristically for Gareth Edwards there's a fair few needle drops early on, the choices can be obvious but always effective and the music by Hans Zimmer is solid. It's mostly just fine up until the third act where it really comes to life and avoids feeling wasted.\n",

            "You know a movie is bad when you take your Asian immigrant dad to go watch it with you and the first thing he says after watching it is \"Okay, which communist wrote this?!\" The movie's message seemed to be America: bad; military: bad; Asia: good. And there didn't seem to be any compelling reason to root for the robots other than the fact that the kid was cute and the other AI were poor villagers. It seems to me that in order for a movie to be good, the message should be complex and universally compelling. I didn't get what the message was, other than what I previously stated. Literally every bad guy was white and American. It's either very biased or very patronizing. On the other hand, I did think the actors did a good job, and the cinematography was outstanding.\n",

            "To be fair this is a movie that deserves less than what I rate it. After my first viewing I'm inclined to be positive about it for several reasons, and I can confidently say that's because Gareth Edwards continues to show his strong points in filmmaking.It's visually striking and easily builds its own world as a memorable sci-fi flick. There is a certain originality to grand scale designs of the human and AI sides of Edwards' world, and that may be the best thing about The Creator.What's also an upside, albeit straight off Rogue One, Edwards is great at deconstructing hope only to build it back up towards the very end. The dreary military oppression combined with the intense, unending action in the majority of the movie strongly reinforces the idea of having little to no hope at a chance of fighting back. This makes the point where the tide turns for the better all the more uplifting and cheer-worthy.Now on the less positive side of the things...\n",
            "The movie leaves no gray areas for you to form your own opinions on what's happening. It's strictly a black&white east/west conflict and I really don't think this is a good way of handling A. I. in movies. Strange thing is, the movie starts off with a much better subversion of your expectations, but gradually gets more predictable and dull. For a really long while, it even really pushes the limits of suspension of disbelief.I'm still amazed by certain parts of The Creator, especially how it handles some of its story elements, and the A. I. assimilation in the eastern society, which is a more original take for the world it establishes. I think after some time and maybe a second viewing, problems I listed may look better or worse depending on how much it'll succeed in evoking the same positive emotions. I'm really curious to see if the charm is in the first viewing only. I really hope not, cause I enjoyed Rogue One even more on several rewatches, and I will hope the same for The Creator.\n",

            "I'll start by saying that I went to see it knowing nothing about the plot, so I didn't have any expectations at all. I enjoyed it despite its flaws that have been pointed out by so many already.Everyone notices similarities with Terminator, Blade Runner, Avatar, and the visual effects and production design smell \"Rogue One\". This can be either good or bad depending on your point of view.Unfortunately the plot has too many unanswered questions which made me scratch my head. I just couldn't accept some of the plot points in the story. Maybe I need to watch the movie a second time to understand it better.I noticed at least a couple of moments where the editing is objectively bad and gave the impression that there wasn't enough footage to work with. I was also surprised to see Hans Zimmer's name in the end credits as the music didn't stand out in this movie.Long story short, I appreciate what Gareth Edwards and everyone else involved achieved in this movie. Gareth Edwards wrote a good story but the actual screenplay needed a bit more work.It's also insane that this was made with such a low budget and as a VFX artist myself I enjoyed the visuals more than anything else.\n",

Get this... it's based on ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! No really, they FINALLY remade/rebooted/did a sequel to NOT A DAMN THING!! OMGOMG, I've waited my whole life for originality! TAG A FRIEND YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS WITH!\"Be that as it may, the film as such is kind of dull and, despite not being based on anything specific, has its share of clichés and ideas that seem borrowed from prior works of sci-fi. It has the strengths we've come to expect from Gareth Edwards (few directors achieve a sense of scale quite like he does; we feel humbled by his versions of Godzilla and the Death Star in a way that we hadn't before) but also exemplifies his weakness when it comes to creating gripping characters.Still, it's hard not to appreciate the movie on some level. Edwards' vision is very much on the screen; it's just that his influences were either too obvious or distracting -- in the sense that they reminded me of more captivating stories I could be watching instead. (Quoth Joe Bro on Twitter, this movie will be \"huge for people who never heard of Akira, or Blade Runner, or The Last of Us, or 9/11.)Regardless, I'm happy I gave it a shot. Some of these images are worthy of the pages of Simon Stålenhag.Here's hoping Edwards someday adapts some of his tales.\n",

A visual spectacle.Although Gareth Edwards pulls through visually, he fails miserably on the storyline. The amount of times my party sat there and looked at each other saying \"wait, what? Why?\" was too much to count. Things didnt add up and begs the audience to question many things. As if Edwards was just trying to get to an ending rather than build the story. Creating that tension or closeness between ai and humans was lacking.John Washington's mono tone, emotionless acting contributed to that disconnect. The exact \"read off the script\" acting we saw in Tenet. How he got this role is mind blowing and nepotism at its finest. His performance was only saved by child actor Madeleine Voyles, who was great. Few other questionable casting decisions, you'll see if you choose to not wait for the stream (the soccer mom playing a ruthless captain)All in all, this film was entertaining at the very least. Could have been awesome as i love how rogue one was done and im not a star wars fanatic.Worth the ticket? Eh yea not bad but definitely not a rewatch.

Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid \"simulants\", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.\n",

It's like a precursor to the \"Terminator\" films with \"Joshua\" (John David Washington) charged with tracking down and destroying a super-weapon being devised by the AI that mankind developed to keep it safe, but that turned the tables on us all and now robots are ruling the Earth. Sound familiar? Well, the whole thing is pretty derivative with only a few, fleeting, scenes from Gemma Chan and a frankly implausible effort from the usually reliable Allison Janney sporting a militaristic haircut as \"Col. Howell\" - the soldier charged with managing our hero on his trek to eliminate whom we quickly learn is \"Alphie\" (Madeleine Yuna Voyles) who has a whopping great hole between it's ears. It's just all been seen and done before and though this does introduce a degree of humanity and sentiment as the story progresses, it is all just a bit, well - been there, seen that and got Will Smith to sign my T-shirt. To be fair, it does move along well enough with plenty of pyrotechnics, explosions and lasers but the story is thin and predictable and the denouement could have been on the drawing board after about ten minutes.

            "In the year 2070, the United States is engaged in a series of proxy battles across New Asia with a nuclear detonation in Los Angeles some years back having served as an inciting incident that outlawed Artificial Intelligence (A. I.) in the United States with war declared on the whole of A. I. with Simulants (A. I. with humanoid features) now seeking refuge in New Asia. Former soldier Joshua Taylor (John David Washington) has since left the service following the loss of his wife Maya (Gemma Chan) during an undercover operation in New Asia five years prior looking for the A. I.'s leader Nirmata. However Colonel Howell (Allison Janney) and General Andrews (Ralph Ineson) approach Taylor telling him his wife may still be alive and enlist him to investigate what's allegedly a new weapon by Nirmata called Alpha-Omega. During the excursion, Taylor is separated from his group and comes to find the Alpha-Omega is in fact a Simulant (Madeleine Yuna Voyles). As Taylor continues his journey across New Asia with Alpha-Omega (whom he calls Alphie) in tow, Taylor finds himself challenged in his position on A. I. and the nature of the conflict.The Creator is the latest film from director Gareth Edwards (Godzilla and Rogue One) that marks the first project from the direct since 2016 which he also co-wrote from his story. The impetus for the film according to Edwards came from when Jordan Vogt-Roberts invited him to accompany him on location filming of Kong: Skull Island which Edwards said spurred the idea of robots fighting in race paddies which would serve as the starting point for the project. Edwards got the project set up at New Regency under the initial title of True Love on a budget of $80 million with many seeing the film as a gamble given it's status as an original IP. I'm pleased to say that the end result is definitely a strong and passionately made sci-fi film with strong underlying ideas and aesthetics even if I feel Edwards makes a misstep with an overly fatalistic approach in some cases.From a purely visual standpoint, The Creator has a really unique look to it. While the film does have the Blade Runner-esque cityscapes you expect from this kind of movie, most of the movie tends to favor a more Earthy aesthetic which allows the robotic characters and creations to really pop out against the more lush natural backgrounds. The movie creates an interesting take on the well trodden \"man vs. Machine\" story with the machines painted in a more sympathetic light in comparison to something like Terminator or Colossus: The Forbin Project telling a very human anti-war narrative where despite the heavy CGI and PG-13 rating the film feels very stakey and tense in how it presents itself. Edwards as a director has always played a very \"boots on the ground\" approach to his films be it in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Monsters, or Godzilla and he definitely brings that same aesthetic here. John David Washington does well as Joshua and gives the role and he has good chemistry with Madeleine Yuna Voyles' Alphie with the two giving the film a feeling of something by way of Children of Men with Starman filtered through an A. I. lens. What I wasn't a fan of was the direction taken in the third act which definitely feels like it's trying to ape the ending of Rogue One to a degree and while it worked there as a welcome counter point to the typical Star Wars formula, here it feels very at odds with the emotional core of the film especially in how it's all about reconciling with \"the Other\". Maybe it's just me but I feel like a story like this probably would've been better served by a more positively skewed note than the one Edwards ends on.I really enjoyed The Creator even if I do have issues with it. In an age where audiences are routinely inundated with legacy franchises and IPs trotted out time and time again, it's nice to see a large scale sci-fi film that feels like it comes from a place of passion and inspiration. Some issues with the ending, but overall a really strong film.\n",
